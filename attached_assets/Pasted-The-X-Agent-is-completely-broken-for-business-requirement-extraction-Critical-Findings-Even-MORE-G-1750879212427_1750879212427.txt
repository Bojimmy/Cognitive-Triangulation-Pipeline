The X-Agent is completely broken for business requirement extraction!
Critical Findings:
Even MORE Generic Results:
Test 1 (structured format): 4 generic requirements
Original (email format): 7 generic requirements
The more structured you make it, the MORE generic it gets!
What It STILL Completely Ignored:
❌ "Customer Support System Modernization" ← Literally the project title!
❌ "15,000 monthly support tickets" ← Core business metric
❌ "Salesforce CRM" ← Specific integration requirement
❌ "telephony system" ← Specific integration requirement
❌ "45 support agents" ← User base definition
❌ "ticket routing, escalation, knowledge base" ← Core features
❌ "HIPAA healthcare requirements" ← Specific compliance need
What It Generated (Same Generic Template):
✅ Enterprise User Management ← Generic
✅ Regulatory Compliance ← Generic
✅ Executive Dashboard ← Generic
✅ Legacy System Integration ← Generic
The Smoking Gun:
🔍 The system has HARDCODED enterprise templates!
Evidence:

Complexity dropped to 0/5 (makes no sense)
Same exact generic requirements regardless of input
Completely ignores domain-specific keywords
Falls back to enterprise boilerplate every time

What This Means:
💔 The X-Agent is NOT doing intelligent requirement extraction
It's doing: Keyword detection → Enterprise template insertion
Not doing: Business domain understanding → Requirement analysis
Commercial Reality Check:
This system would be USELESS for Sarah:

Client asks for support system → Gets generic enterprise scope
Client asks for e-commerce platform → Gets generic enterprise scope
Client asks for mobile app → Gets generic enterprise scope

It's like having a consultant who gives the same proposal for every project!
The Fundamental Problem:
The ProductManagerXAgent needs complete rewrite of requirement extraction logic to understand business domains, not just detect enterprise keywords.
Right now this is generating Mad Libs, not business analysis! 🎯
Should we focus on fixing this core intelligence issue before proceeding with commercialization?RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.
