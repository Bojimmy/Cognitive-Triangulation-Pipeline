Issue 2: Broken Requirement Extraction (Root Cause)
The problem: ProductManagerXAgent is looking for explicit "REQ-001:" patterns, but you gave it natural business language.
Your input: "Our metropolitan area is experiencing severe traffic..."
Agent expects: "REQ-001: Traffic Management System\nREQ-002: Mobile App..."
The Fix for Requirement Extraction:
Replace the regex-based extraction with natural language processing:
pythondef _extract_requirements_from_natural_language(self, content: str) -> list:
    """Extract requirements from natural business language"""
    
    # Split into sentences and find requirement-like statements
    sentences = content.split('.')
    requirements = []
    req_id = 1
    
    for sentence in sentences:
        sentence = sentence.strip()
        
        # Look for requirement indicators
        if any(indicator in sentence.lower() for indicator in [
            'needs to', 'must', 'should', 'requires', 'system', 
            'platform', 'application', 'users', 'integration'
        ]):
            if len(sentence) > 20:  # Filter out short fragments
                requirements.append({
                    'id': f"REQ-{req_id:03d}",
                    'title': sentence[:100] + "..." if len(sentence) > 100 else sentence,
                    'priority': 'high' if any(word in sentence.lower() for word in ['critical', 'essential', 'must']) else 'medium'
                })
                req_id += 1
    
    return requirements[:8]  # Limit to 8 key requirements
Quick Fix Strategy:
1. Fix Port First (1 minute):
Either change Flask to port 5002 OR change frontend to port 5000
2. Fix Requirements (Give Replit this code):
Tell Replit: "Replace the regex requirement extraction with natural language processing that looks for sentences containing requirement indicators like 'needs to', 'must', 'should', 'requires', 'system', etc."
The port issue will fix the 500 error immediately. The requirement extraction will make the pipeline actually work with business language! ðŸš€RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.Research Sonnet 4
