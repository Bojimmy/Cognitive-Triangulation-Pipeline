Develop an AI-powered personalized learning platform for K-12 students. The platform should dynamically adapt learning paths based on student performance and learning style, recommend educational content (videos, articles, interactive exercises), and provide real-time progress tracking. It must include gamification elements to enhance engagement. Teachers need a dashboard to monitor student progress, assign custom content, and generate performance reports. Parents require a portal to view their child's progress and communicate with teachers. The system should support various subjects (Math, Science, English) and integrate with existing school management systems for student data. Ensure robust data privacy and security measures are in place.
